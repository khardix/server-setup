# Ansible-managed configuration of personal VPS

This repository contains configuration of my VPS in the form of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles and scripts.
It serves primarily as a playground for learning Ansible, secodary as a git-versioned backup of my configuration changes (similar to dotfiles for desktop).
